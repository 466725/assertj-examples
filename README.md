## AssertJ assertions examples

**assertj-examples** contains executable AssertJ assertions examples that you can run as JUnit tests.  
Please have a look at **[assertions examples sources](assertions-examples/src/test/java/org/assertj/examples)**.

the **master** branch represents examples with the latest released version of assertj modules => you should be able to build it with `mvn install` command.

the **with-latest-snapshot-versions** branch represents examples with the on going development version (maven snapshot) => you must build the dependent snapshot version before.


## Contributing

Contributing is easy, only two rules to follow : 
* Use **[AssertJ code Eclipse formatting preferences](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/tree/master/src/formatters/assertj-eclipse-formatter.xml)** (for Idea users, it is possible to import it)
* Add FUN examples ! ;-)

Thanks !
