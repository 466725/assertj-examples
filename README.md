## AssertJ examples

The **master** branch represents examples with the latest released version of AssertJ modules => you should be able to build it with `mvn install` command.

The **with-latest-snapshot-versions** branch represents examples with the on going development version (maven snapshot) => you must build the dependent snapshot version before.

## Contributing

Contributing is easy, only two rules to follow : 
* Use **[AssertJ code Eclipse formatting preferences](https://github.com/joel-costigliola/assertj-core/tree/master/src/formatters/assertj-eclipse-formatter.xml)** (for Idea users, it is possible to import it)
* Add FUN examples ! ;-)

Thanks !
